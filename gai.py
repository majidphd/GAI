    According to :red[(Andrew Ng)] Generative AI 
    able to do many of the things that a college 
    student following instructions might be able 
    to do. Some of its common use cases including 
    writing, reading, and chatting. For building 
    generative AI projects, we should includ the 
    life cycle of the project, with a variety of 
    technology options, such as prompting, retrieval 
    augmented generation, and fine tuning. Finally, 
    automation or augmentation could lead to new 
    workflows that don't just realize cost savings, 
    but lead to significant brand new value creation.
